# ``Instafilter``

An app that lets the user import photos from their library, then modify them using various image effects.

## Overview

The app utilizes Apple's Core Image framework for manipulating images. It has dozens of example image filters for use,
providing things like blurs, color shifts, pixellation, and more, and all are optimized to take full advantage of the 
graphics processing unit (GPU) on iOS devices.

The app also shows how to integrate SwiftUI and UIKit, since a number of Apple's frameworks don't have SwiftUI wrappers yet,
e.g. MapKit, and Safari, among others.
