# ``HotProspects``

An app to track who you meet at conferences.

## Overview

**NOTE**
Because this project uses a `TabView`, it doesn't work well being presented by the `NavigationStack` in the main app. In order to get it to work, it either has to be a standalone project, or comment out the `List` in `ContentView` (of the main app), and display `HotProspectsView()`.
